        <h4>it is famous for "Sri laxhmi Narashima Swamy temple" </h4>
        <p>There is a legendary story behind the construction of the temple. The story goes as a farmer tilling his farm land and rearing a cow for a livelihood. While tilling his land, his ploughs got obstructed by a black stone. The farmer took the stone from his farm and placed it aside. But to the surprise of the farmer, the stone got placed in the same place every time he tried to relocate it. The farmer still could not realize the holiness of the stone that had actually been the Linga. Helpless he prayed to Lord Srimannarayana Swamy to help him out. Soon the reigning king of the area, Singamanaidu of Surabhi family had a dream where he was instructed by the Lord to construct a temple where the idol placed in the farmerâ€™s land is installed and worshipped regularly. The king immediately carried out the instructions. And very soon the idol of Goddess Ratna Lakshmi was also brought down from Chennai and installed at the Ratnagiri Hills which is just half a kilometer from the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple. This was carried out in 1857 A.D.</p>
        <h4>Specialites of temple</h4>
        <p>Singapattanam is a unique place where Lord Shiva is worshipped as Sri Narasimha Swamy in the Linga form and Vishnu as the idol has Thripundras (Addanamas) and Urdhvapundras (Niluvunamas). Besides the Ratna Lakshmi Amman temple is located in the nearby hill.
            The priests so appointed are from Sri Vatsa Gothrikas and also from Oruganti families who are serving the temple to this day. Pilgrims offer pumpkins to the Lord to cast away their problems. They also put jaggery pieces to the water body just beside the temple. There is also a belief that the Narisimha Sagaram (Srivari Samudram), the water body near the temple gets filled once in every seven years. Pilgrims also believe that the Lord would tell them their past and the future. They also observe that the idol of the Lord is growing year by year.
